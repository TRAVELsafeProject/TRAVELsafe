### Description

Travel Safe has been created to help the LGBTQ+ community get real information about the conditions they can find in their travel destinations thanks to the user comments about real experiences. For the moment, you can find the information about Spain’s most important cities, so you can be aware of what’s waiting for you and change your itinerary if needed.

Hope to help you and enjoy Travel Safe!
